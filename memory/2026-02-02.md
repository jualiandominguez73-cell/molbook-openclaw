### Agent Architecture Established
- **AGENTS.md vs SOUL.md pattern clarified**: AGENTS.md = comprehensive knowledge base (everything they need to know), SOUL.md = persona/tone/boundaries only. This follows OpenClaw docs - both are loaded every session, but AGENTS.md is the "training manual" and SOUL.md is "who they are."
- Restructured all three CEO agents (Matt, Sally, Andy) with this pattern
- Removed non-standard `AGENT.md` files (not part of OpenClaw bootstrap)

### MeshGuard Twenty CRM Setup
- **Dashboard:** https://meshguard.mollified.app
- **API:** https://api.mollified.app/rest
- Created custom fields via GraphQL metadata API:
  - **Company:** Industry, Customer Stage, Contract Tier, Lead Source, Agent Count
  - **Person:** Role Type, Champion, Decision Maker
  - **Opportunity:** Use Case, Contract Term, Primary Framework, POC Status, Competition
- Created **Design Partner** custom object with fields
- Full spec: `/Users/steve/meshguard-matt/docs/crm-setup.md`
- Workflows need to be configured via Twenty UI (Settings → Workflows)
- Steve Agent account created (steve@withagency.ai) - credentials in 1Password

### Beancount Finance Infrastructure
- Set up plain-text accounting for all three startups
- **MeshGuard:** Full SaaS chart of accounts, Stripe import script, README
- **SaveState:** Developer tool accounts (Pro $9/mo, Team $29/mo tiers)
- **UndercoverAgent:** Pre-revenue accounts (waitlist stage)
- Location: `<agent>/finance/` directory for each
- AI agents can read/write ledger files directly - no API needed

### 1Password Access (TOOLS.md updated)
- Never use direct `op` CLI - hangs on biometrics
- Always use tmux `op-safe` session with password from `~/.openclaw/.env`
- Credentials saved:
  - "MeshGuard Twenty CRM API Key" (workspace API key)
  - "MeshGuard Twenty CRM - Steve Agent" (my login)

### TradingView Signal
- SELL BTCUSDT @ $77,093 logged at 21:12 EST (R:R 2.65, RSI 36.71)

### Build Issue
- TypeScript error in sync: `ExtensionContext` not assignable to `AgentToolUpdateCallback` - may need attention

## Local Fork Patches

### Multi-agent group mention yielding (Feb 2)
- **File**: `src/telegram/bot-message-context.ts`
- **What**: Open bots yield when another bot is @mentioned
- **Why**: Multiple CEO agents in same group - don't want all responding when one is mentioned
- **Commit**: d4a2154b0
- **Maintain**: May need to reapply after upstream merges if this file conflicts
