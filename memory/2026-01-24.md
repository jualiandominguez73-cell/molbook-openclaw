## MeshGuard Business Pitch (from David's email)

David shared a detailed business pitch for **MeshGuard** - a governance control plane for enterprise AI agent meshes.

### Core Thesis
- Agents will proliferate inside every enterprise app and workflow
- Governance, identity, permissioning, and auditability become the monetization layer
- Similar to how identity, API management, and endpoint security became mandatory control planes

### What MeshGuard Builds
- Security and operations layer for enterprises with thousands of AI agents:
  - Personal agents (employee-owned, on their devices)
  - Enterprise agents (company-owned)
  - Partner agents (external, delegating work)

### Key Features
1. **Agent Identity & Enrollment** - Personal agent enrollment portal, IdP integration, trust tiers
2. **Private Skill Registry** - Signing, review, rollout controls for enterprise automation library
3. **Capability Surfaces** - Declare read/write/execute boundaries for skills
4. **Delegation Protocol** - Permission ceilings, depth limits, signed receipts for agent-to-agent calls
5. **DLP Enforcement** - Cross-boundary data loss prevention and redaction
6. **Unified Audit** - Correlation across all agent calls for compliance

### Moats
- Capability surfaces + signed receipts = switching costs
- Private skill registries = automation library lock-in
- Trust graph + delegation metadata = hard to replicate
- Clawdbot open source = distribution, MeshGuard = monetization

### Business Model
- Subscription tiers by agent count + usage
- Target: Security teams, IT/platform engineering, regulated industries

### Roadmap
- **0-6 months**: Enrollment portal, IdP integration, trust tiers, private skill registry, capability surfaces, audit
- **6-12 months**: Agent mesh gateway, delegation envelopes, permission ceilings, approval orchestration, DLP
- **12-24 months**: Partner federation, cross-agent analytics, anomaly detection, MCP interop

### Key Info
- **Domain:** meshguard.app
- **Contact:** david@meshguard.app

### Fundraising
- Seed round to build control plane
- Design partner deployments in security/IT
- Use of funds: product engineering, enterprise integrations (SSO, SIEM), design partner program
