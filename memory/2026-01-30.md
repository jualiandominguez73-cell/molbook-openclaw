## SaveState v0.4.2 Released

Fixed critical bugs from launch review:
- **Cloud push "file not found"** — was looking in `.savestate/` instead of `~/.savestate/snapshots/`
- **CLI version stuck on 0.1.0** — now reads dynamically from package.json
- **SEO fixes** — Added robots.txt, sitemap.xml, OG/Twitter meta tags, install.sh to site

Launch review completed by sub-agent: **84% score, approved for launch** ✅

## OpenClaw Rebrand

Project rebranded from Moltbot → OpenClaw:
- CLI: `openclaw` (was `moltbot`)
- Docs: docs.openclaw.ai
- Config: `~/.openclaw/`
- macOS app: `OpenClaw.app`

Local setup has symlinks: `~/.clawdbot` → `~/.moltbot` → `~/.openclaw`
Still running old `moltbot` binary — will rebuild to `openclaw` tonight.

## Omega Foundation — New Incubation Project

AI-powered Montessori homeschool concept (like Alpha School but for homeschoolers).
- Website: https://omega.foundation/
- Added to Vikunja Inbox (Task #228)
- Research completed by sub-agent — saved to `memory/omega-foundation-research.md`

**Key findings:**
- Homeschool market: 3.1M students, $600/year average spend
- Alpha School charges $10K-$75K/year — only for affluent families
- Middle tier ($50-200/mo) is wide open
- Recommended model: $149/mo family subscription

## Distribution Strategy Discussion

From David's meeting with Bob from G20:
- When AI can build products rapidly, **distribution becomes the bottleneck**
- Added SaveState distribution tasks to Vikunja (Project 5):
  - VS Code Extension (high priority)
  - GitHub Action (high priority)
  - Product Hunt launch
  - Dev influencer outreach
  - Integration plugins (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code)
  - Open source community building

## MeshGuard SOC 2

Created comprehensive SOC 2 readiness checklist for MeshGuard.
- Saved to `memory/meshguard-soc2-checklist.md`
- Added to Bear with tags `#meshguard`, `#soc2`, `#compliance`
- Estimated cost: ~$46K Year 1 (platform + auditor)
- Timeline: 9-12 months to Type II report

## Mission Control Dashboard — Built, Deployed & Integrated ✅

David saw a "Mission Control" screenshot for managing AI agents and wanted one for DBH Ventures.

Built and deployed to Vercel:
- **URL:** https://dbh-mission-control.vercel.app
- **Repo:** github.com/dbhurley/dbh-mission-control (private)
- **Local code:** /Users/steve/Git/dbh-mission-control/

Features:
- Agent sidebar with status badges (WORKING/STANDBY)
- Kanban task board (Inbox → In Progress → Complete)
- Documentation panel with playbooks and outputs
- DBH Ventures branding, amber accent colors
- **Vikunja integration complete** — pulls live tasks from projects.timespent.xyz

Agent assignment via Vikunja labels (`agent:scout`, `agent:builder`, etc.):
- 🛠 Builder: 7 tasks (VS Code ext, GitHub Action, Stripe, Printful, etc.)
- 🐺 Steve: 5 tasks (triage, oversight, decided items)
- ✍️ Scribe: 3 tasks (Product Hunt, influencer outreach, community)
- 🎨 Canvas: 2 tasks (UI mockups, seed gallery artwork)
- 🔍 Scout: 2 tasks (SkillHealth research, AI Skill Verification)
- 📊 Analyst: 0 tasks
- 🛡 Sentinel: 0 tasks

**Tech details:**
- `src/lib/vikunja.ts` — API client with token caching
- `src/app/api/tasks/route.ts` — transforms Vikunja tasks → Mission Control format
- Filters out template project (ID 3)
- Maps Vikunja priority → LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH
- Maps task status via percent_done

## Scout UI Changes (Rolled Back)

Tried improving MeshGuard Scout demo UX:
- Friendlier greeting
- Quick action cards
- Persistent prompt chips

David rejected them ("not real improvements") — rolled back all changes.

## Tailwind CSS v4 Cascade Bug — LESSON LEARNED

**Problem:** Mission Control dashboard had no padding on mobile despite `px-4` classes being applied.

**Root Cause:** In Tailwind v4, all utilities are in `@layer utilities`. I had a CSS reset outside any layer:
```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

**Unlayered CSS has HIGHER cascade priority than layered CSS** — so this reset was overriding every Tailwind padding/margin class, even though `*` has lower specificity.

**Fix:** 
1. Remove the `* { margin: 0; padding: 0 }` reset (Tailwind's preflight handles this)
2. Put ALL custom CSS inside proper `@layer` directives:
   - `@layer base` — theme variables, html/body, scrollbar
   - `@layer components` — custom component classes
   - `@layer utilities` — animations, custom utilities

**Rule for future:** When using Tailwind v4, NEVER put CSS outside of `@layer` blocks — it will override Tailwind utilities.

## MeshGuard — Actually Production Ready

Deep dive confirmed MeshGuard is more complete than previously thought:

**What's working:**
- ✅ Gateway live at dashboard.meshguard.app (enforce mode)
- ✅ Dashboard UI with magic code email login
- ✅ Signup → org + API key + admin token
- ✅ Stripe billing live (checkout sessions work!)
- ✅ SDKs: Python (`pip install meshguard`), JS, .NET
- ✅ Docs site (docs.meshguard.app) — 24+ pages
- ✅ Learning/blog site (learn.meshguard.app)
- ✅ Sitemap submitted to Google

**Tested end-to-end:**
```bash
# Signup works
POST /signup → org + credentials

# Agent creation works
POST /admin/agents → JWT token

# Policy enforcement works
GET /proxy/get → 403 "Default deny from scout-visitor"

# Audit logging works
GET /admin/audit → full trace with agent, decision, policy
```

**What's stopping customers:** Distribution. Product is ready, nobody knows it exists.

## MeshGuard Scanner Idea — Parked

Discussed building a scanner/demo tool for enterprise sales. Goal: walk into CxO meeting and show them their ungoverned AI agents.

**Key insight from David:** Focus on **data leaking** — AI agents accessing and potentially exposing company data without governance.

Technical approaches explored but none were compelling enough for CxO demo:
- Code scanner (doesn't scale to enterprise)
- API call volume (doesn't distinguish agents from chatbots)
- Cloud infrastructure scan (too technical)

**Parked for later.** Need a more visceral "show them the breach" demo.

## Personal AI Firewall — EVALUATED & PASSED

New idea from moltbook meme: consumer product to prevent personal AI agents from leaking PII.

**Scout researched and recommended: NO (Pass)**

Key findings:
- **Caviard.ai** is this exact product — 50K users, $6/mo total revenue
- Only ~3% of AI users pay for anything
- Open source alternatives abundant (Trylon, LLM Guard)
- AI platforms adding native privacy features
- B2C privacy tools historically don't monetize

Enterprise is where AI security money flows (Lakera $20M, Nightfall), but that's capital-intensive.

Task #231 created, assigned to Scout, researched, and marked complete — full Mission Control workflow.

## Mission Control — First Successful Sub-Agent Dispatch

Manually triggered Scout via `sessions_spawn`:
1. Created task in Vikunja Inbox (project 1)
2. Added `agent:scout` label (ID 2)
3. Spawned Scout with research task
4. Scout completed in 2m9s with full report
5. Marked task #231 complete via Vikunja API

**Automation needed:** Cron/webhook to auto-detect new tasks and dispatch to appropriate agent.

## Local Memory Embeddings — Configured

Configured OpenClaw to use local embeddings (embeddinggemma-300M-Q8_0.gguf):
- Updated config: `agents.defaults.memorySearch.provider = "local"`
- Fallback: OpenAI
- Uses node-llama-cpp (no Ollama needed)
- Gateway restart required to activate

Note: Installed Ollama via brew but it's not actually needed — can uninstall.

## SOUL.md Update

Added rule: **Never curse. Ever. Full stop.**

## Notes

- Sub-agent completion notifications can get lost in chat flow — Mission Control dashboard will help with visibility
- David prefers to wait until tonight to do the OpenClaw CLI rebuild to avoid breaking things during the day
- Vikunja URLs: projects.timespent.xyz (Mission Control uses this), projects.mollified.app (skill config, was 502ing)
