## Morning Session (~6:00-7:15 AM)

### VOTD Cron Issue
- Daily verse cron ran at 6:05 AM but delivery failed
- System thought both Telegram and WhatsApp were unavailable
- Likely timing issue - providers hadn't initialized yet after overnight
- Manually delivered Luke 12:40 to David via Telegram

### Upstream Sync Fixed
- Merged 12 additional upstream commits (was behind after 4 AM sync)
- Fixed sync script (`~/.clawd/scripts/sync-skills.sh`):
  - OLD: kept local `skills/` on conflicts (bad - missed upstream skill updates)
  - NEW: takes upstream for `skills/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `README.md`
  - Still keeps local for personalized files (AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, USER.md, memory/)
- Now fully in sync: 0 behind, 223 ahead

### Steve Sticker Integration
- Fetched all 23 stickers from Telegram pack `steve_fox_by_Steve_The_AI_Bot`
- Created mapping file: `assets/stickers/steve-telegram-stickers.json`
- Created helper script: `scripts/send-steve-sticker.sh <emotion>`
- Emotions available: neutral, happy, sad, thinking, looking, surprised, smirk, pirate, smart, santa, fancy, slight_smile, ghost, reindeer, chef, crying, love, wink, kiss, laughing, party, sobbing, thumbs_up
- Deleted redundant `index.jpg` from sticker pack folder

### Stats
- 89 skills in workspace
- Media sync running hourly ✓

### Family Schedule
- **4:30 PM** — Samuel trumpet lesson @ LHS (Lexington High School). David driving.

### Preferences Learned
- **Reminder timing**: David prefers ~1 hour heads up for events, not several hours.

### Lessons Learned
- **Clock awareness**: Don't assume time from heartbeat counts. Current time is in message timestamps (UTC). David's TZ is America/New_York (EST = UTC-5).

## Midday Session (~10:30 AM - 12:15 PM)

### Skills Published to ClawdHub
1. **xkcd v1.0.0** - Fetch latest/random/specific comics, search by keyword, xkcd-style image generation prompts
2. **pptx-creator v1.0.0** - Create PowerPoint from markdown/JSON. 6 style templates (minimal, corporate, creative, dark, executive, startup). Custom template support, analyzer.

### Cron Job Fixes
- **Root cause**: Crons with `deliver: true` were ALSO telling the agent to "send via Telegram", causing agent to try `message` tool which lacked bot token in isolated sessions
- **Fix applied to Steve's 11 cron jobs**: Added proper `deliver: true`, `provider: telegram`, `to: 1191367022` and message says "Delivery is handled automatically"
- **Opie's 2 crons**: Set `deliver: false` and use `message` tool with `accountId: opie` so they come from Opie's bot, not Steve's
- **Also added**: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` to `~/.zshenv`

### Installed Skills
