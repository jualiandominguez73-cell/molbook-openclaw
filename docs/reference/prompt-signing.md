# Prompt signing reference

This document covers the architecture of OpenClaw's prompt signing system:
template signing, the verify tool, message signing, the verification gate,
the mutation gate, and session security state.

For the conceptual overview, see [Prompt signing](/concepts/prompt-signing).

## Components

```
Build time:
  Developer signs templates -> .sig/sigs/llm/prompts/*.sig.json

Runtime (per turn):
  User message arrives
    -> resetVerification(sessionKey, turnId)
    -> signMessage() if sender is owner
    -> Agent runs, calls verify tool
    -> setVerified(sessionKey, turnId)
    -> Gated tools now unblocked for this turn
```

### Template files

System prompt sections are stored as text files in `llm/prompts/`. Each file
corresponds to a section of the system prompt (identity, safety, tooling,
etc.) and may contain `{{placeholder}}` tokens for dynamic interpolation.

Templates are signed with [sig](https://github.com/disreguard/sig) and the
signatures are stored in `.sig/sigs/llm/prompts/`. The `.sig/config.json`
configures the template engine (`jinja`) and signing identity (`openclaw`).

**Signing templates:**

```bash
sig sign llm/prompts/*.txt --by openclaw
```

**Checking signature status:**

```bash
sig check
```

### Template loading

`src/agents/prompt-templates.ts` provides synchronous template loading with
in-memory caching:

- `loadTemplate(name)` — load a template file from `llm/prompts/`
- `interpolate(template, data)` — replace `{{placeholder}}` tokens
- `loadAndInterpolate(name, data)` — load and interpolate in one step

### The verify tool

The `verify` tool (`src/agents/tools/sig-verify-tool.ts`) is an owner-only
tool that provides two verification modes:

**Template verification** (default):

- Call `verify` with no arguments to verify all signed templates
- Call `verify` with `file: "identity.txt"` to verify a specific template
- Returns `allVerified`, per-template results with the original signed
  content (placeholders visible), signer identity, and timestamp
- On successful verification, marks the session as verified for the
  current turn

**Message verification:**

- Call `verify` with `message: "<signatureId>"` to verify a signed message
- Returns the original content and provenance metadata if valid
- Signature IDs follow the format `<sessionId>:<channel>:<messageId>`

The tool resolves the project root lazily (on first call) since
`findProjectRoot` is async.

### Message signing

`src/agents/message-signing.ts` signs owner messages at ingestion time using
the sig `ContentStore`. Each session gets its own in-memory store that
persists across turns within the session.

When `senderIsOwner` is true and a `senderId` is available, the runner signs
the inbound message with an identity string built from the sender info
(e.g., `owner:+1234567890:whatsapp`).

Message signature IDs are namespaced as `<sessionId>:<channel>:<messageId>`
to avoid collisions across channels.

### Session security state

`src/agents/session-security-state.ts` tracks per-session, per-turn
verification status.

- `resetVerification(sessionId, turnId)` — called at the start of each turn;
  sets status to `unverified`
- `setVerified(sessionId, turnId)` — called by the verify tool after
  successful template verification
- `isVerified(sessionId, turnId)` — checked by the verification gate

State is in-memory and turn-scoped. A new user message generates a new
`turnId` (UUID), which invalidates the previous turn's verification.

### The verification gate

`src/agents/sig-verification-gate.ts` implements the deterministic check that
runs in the `before_tool_call` hook pipeline.

**Execution order in `pi-tools.before-tool-call.ts`:**

1. **Verification gate** (runs first, cannot be overridden)
2. **Mutation gate** (runs second, blocks writes to protected files)
3. Plugin `before_tool_call` hooks (run third)

The verification gate checks:

1. Is enforcement enabled? (`agents.defaults.sig.enforceVerification`)
2. Is this a gated tool?
3. Is the session verified for this turn?

If the tool is gated and the session is not verified, the gate returns a
block with an actionable message instructing the agent to call `verify`
first.

**Default gated tools:**

`exec`, `write`, `edit`, `apply_patch`, `message`, `gateway`,
`sessions_spawn`, `sessions_send`, `update_and_sign`

### The mutation gate

`src/agents/sig-mutation-gate.ts` intercepts `write` and `edit` tool calls
that target files with sig file policies (`mutable: true`). It blocks the
call and directs the agent to use `update_and_sign` instead.

The gate resolves the tool's target path (from `params.path` or
`params.file_path`) relative to the project root, then checks it against
the file policies in `.sig/config.json` using `resolveFilePolicy()`.

`apply_patch` is also checked by the mutation gate. File paths are parsed
from the patch content markers (`*** Add File:`, `*** Update File:`,
`*** Delete File:`) and checked against file policies.

### The update_and_sign tool

`src/agents/tools/sig-update-tool.ts` is an owner-only tool for modifying
protected workspace files. It validates provenance before allowing changes.

**Parameters:**

- `file` — file path relative to workspace root
- `content` — new file content
- `reason` — why the update is being made
- `sourceType` — `"signed_message"` or `"signed_template"`
- `sourceId` — signature ID of the source that authorized the change

**Provenance validation:**

The tool calls sig's `updateAndSign()` which checks:

1. The file has a policy with `mutable: true`
2. The caller's identity matches `authorizedIdentities` (e.g., `owner:*`)
3. If `requireSignedSource: true`, the `sourceId` resolves to a valid
   signature in the session ContentStore

If any check fails, the update is denied with an actionable error message.

### File policies

File policies are configured in `.sig/config.json` under the `files` key:

```json
{
  "files": {
    "llm/prompts/*.txt": {
      "mutable": false
    },
    "soul.md": {
      "mutable": true,
      "authorizedIdentities": ["owner:*"],
      "requireSignedSource": true
    }
  }
}
```

| Field                  | Type     | Description                                           |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `mutable`              | boolean  | Whether the file can be updated via `update_and_sign` |
| `authorizedIdentities` | string[] | Identity patterns allowed to update (e.g., `owner:*`) |
| `requireSignedSource`  | boolean  | Require a valid signed source for updates             |

Files with `mutable: false` (like templates) are immutable. Any
modification is detected by the `verify` tool on the next verification
check.

### Workspace initialization

`src/agents/sig-workspace-init.ts` signs workspace files that have
`mutable: true` policies but no existing signatures. This runs on the
first agent run for a session and establishes the initial chain anchor.

The init uses identity `workspace:init`. This is a bootstrap identity
-- `authorizedIdentities` constrains who can _update_ (via
`update_and_sign`), not who originally signed.

## Configuration

```json5
{
  agents: {
    defaults: {
      sig: {
        // Enable the verification gate (default: false)
        enforceVerification: true,

        // Override the default gated tool set (optional)
        gatedTools: ["exec", "write", "edit", "message"],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

| Key                                       | Type     | Default     | Description                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `agents.defaults.sig.enforceVerification` | boolean  | `false`     | Block gated tools until verify is called  |
| `agents.defaults.sig.gatedTools`          | string[] | (see above) | Override which tools require verification |

## Integration with tool policy

The `verify` and `update_and_sign` tools are registered in
`OWNER_ONLY_TOOL_NAMES`. Non-owner senders do not see either tool and are
not subject to the verification or mutation gates (they already have
restricted tool access via `applyOwnerOnlyToolPolicy`).

Both tools are added to the tools array in `createOpenClawCodingTools`
before the owner-only policy is applied, so they are available to owner
senders regardless of other tool policy filters.

## Runner integration

In `src/agents/pi-embedded-runner/run/attempt.ts`, at the start of each
embedded run:

1. A `turnId` is generated (`crypto.randomUUID()`)
2. Verification is reset for the session
3. A `MessageSigningContext` is created or retrieved for the session
4. If the sender is the owner, the inbound message is signed
5. The sig project root and config are resolved (cached after first call)
6. Workspace files with `mutable: true` policies are signed if unsigned
7. A `senderIdentity` string is built for the `update_and_sign` tool
8. All context (`messageSigning`, `turnId`, `senderIdentity`, `projectRoot`,
   `sigConfig`) is passed to `createOpenClawCodingTools`, which threads
   them to the verify/update tools and the hook context

## Security model

sig v1 uses content hashing (SHA-256), not cryptographic signatures with
keys. This means:

- **Modification detection:** if a template changes, verification fails
- **Provenance:** who signed it and when
- **Not forgery-resistant:** anyone with write access to `.sig/` can re-sign

For the standard deployment (developer signs at authoring time, agent
verifies at runtime, `.sig/` is read-only to the agent), content hashing
is sufficient. The agent cannot write to `.sig/` and cannot forge
verification results.

Both the verification gate and the mutation gate are orchestrator-level and
deterministic. They cannot be bypassed by prompt injection because they run
in the tool-call pipeline code, not in the prompt.

Mutable workspace files (`soul.md`, `agents.md`, `heartbeat.md`) are
protected by sig file policies. Direct writes are intercepted and redirected
to the `update_and_sign` tool, which validates that the change traces back
to a signed owner message. This addresses persistence attacks where an agent
is tricked via indirect prompt injection into modifying its identity or
configuration files.
