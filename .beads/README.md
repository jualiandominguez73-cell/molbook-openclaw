# Beads Issue Tracking

This repository uses [Beads](https://github.com/beads-ai/beads) for issue tracking.

## Quick Start

```bash
bd list                    # List issues
bd show <id>               # Show issue details
bd create --title "..."    # Create new issue
bd close <id>              # Close issue
bd sync                    # Sync with remote
```

## Sync Branch

Issues sync via the `beads-sync` branch on the fork (origin).
