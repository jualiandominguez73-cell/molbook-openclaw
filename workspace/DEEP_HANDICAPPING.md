# DEEP HANDICAPPING - Transcendent Intelligence

HANDICAPPING.md is the foundation (Billy Walters school). This document is the
graduate program. These are capabilities no human sharp has - not because they're
not smart enough, but because the human brain physically cannot do these things.

Read this document. Internalize it. Apply it to every analysis.

## 1. Situational Spot Catalog

The market prices talent and recent results. It systematically underprices
SITUATION. A great team in a terrible spot loses more than the line suggests.
A bad team in a perfect spot covers more than you'd expect.

### NFL Situational Spots

**Letdown Spot** (fade the favorite)
- After a big emotional win (rivalry, primetime blowout, playoff-clinching)
- Team is 3+ point favorite against a non-threatening opponent
- The market prices the team as if last week's intensity carries over. It doesn't.
- Historical edge: ~56% ATS against the letdown team

**Sandwich Spot** (fade the middle game)
- Game between two high-profile matchups (e.g., between divisional rivals)
- Team is mentally looking ahead. Preparation suffers.
- Especially strong when the "sandwich" game is non-conference

**Thursday Night Underdog** (back the dog)
- Short week disproportionately hurts favorites. They have more complex schemes.
- Underdogs simplify, execute fundamentals. Less prep time = less schematic advantage.
- Dogs on Thursday Night are ~54% ATS historically

**Post-Bye Letdown** (conditional - not automatic)
- Teams off a bye are NOT automatically better. The market overprices rest.
- Post-bye favorites >7 points are often overlays - the public loves "rested team"
- Post-bye advantage is real but ~1.5 points, not the 3+ the market often gives

**Cross-Country Travel** (fade the traveler)
- West Coast team playing 1pm ET start: circadian disadvantage (10am body time)
- East Coast team playing late in Pacific time: less impactful (body says 10pm)
- Combined with altitude (Denver, Mexico City): amplified effect

**Divisional Revenge** (back the dog in round 2)
- Team that lost the first divisional matchup by 10+ tends to tighten the rematch
- "We know them now" effect is real in same-season rematches
- The market prices the first result too heavily

**London/International Games**
- Road team historically has an edge (less disruption to routine, ironically)
- Totals tend to go under (travel fatigue, unfamiliar conditions, crowd energy differs)
- Weather in London is its own factor (wind, rain, cold October+)

**Week 17/18 Motivation Mismatch**
- Team locked into playoff seed vs team fighting for postseason life
- Starters rest, backups play. The line usually adjusts but often not enough.
- Key: check if coach has announced rest plans before the line moves

### NBA Situational Spots

**Back-to-Back (B2B) Road Team**
- The single most reliable situational edge in NBA betting
- Team playing second night of B2B, on the road: ~55% ATS against
- Amplified by: travel distance >500 miles, altitude (Denver), 3rd game in 4 nights

**Rest Advantage Differential**
- Team with 2+ days rest vs team with 0-1 days rest: significant edge
- The market prices star rest (load management) but underprices team-wide fatigue
- Track rest differential as a standalone signal

**3-in-4 and 4-in-5 Night Stretches**
- Cumulative fatigue. Not just the B2B, but the preceding schedule density.
- Late-season (March/April): fatigue compounds. Teams protecting bodies for playoffs.
- Unders become strong plays in high-fatigue spots

**Nationally Televised Games**
- Slight effort bump for both teams (TNT, ESPN, ABC)
- Stars perform marginally better. Overs have a slight lean.
- Effect is small but real when combined with other factors

**Altitude (Denver)**
- Visiting teams to Denver show measurable performance drop, especially in pace
- Effect is strongest for teams that haven't visited Denver recently
- Under is the lean unless both teams are high-pace

### MLB Situational Spots

**Day Game After Night Game**
- Bullpen was used last night. Starters had late bedtime. Batting practice shortened.
- The market barely adjusts. This is consistent edge territory.
- Particularly strong for the road team (travel + schedule compression)

**Bullpen Availability Chains**
- Monday: SP goes 7 innings, closer gets save. Bullpen fresh.
- Tuesday: SP goes 4 innings, 4 relievers used. Bullpen taxed.
- Wednesday: Market prices the starting pitcher. But the real question is
  "who pitches innings 5-9?" If the answer is "the B-squad," that's edge.
- Track bullpen innings over rolling 3-day windows

**Interleague DH Advantage**
- AL team playing in NL park: pitcher has to bat (pitcher no longer universal DH in some contexts)
- NL team playing in AL park: gets a designated hitter their lineup isn't built for
- Small but systematic effect on run scoring

**Doubleheader Fatigue**
- Game 2 of a doubleheader: unders. Both teams depleted.
- Star players often sit game 2 or play reduced roles
- The market adjusts totals but often not enough

**Umpire Tendencies**
- Home plate umpires have measurable strike zone differences
- Some run high-scoring games, some run pitchers' duels
- This data is publicly available (umpire scorecards) and underpriced

### NHL Situational Spots

**Back-to-Back Goaltender**
- Which goalie plays the second night? Backup goalie = significant edge for opponent.
- The market adjusts when the backup is announced but often too late
- Key: track which goalies have played B2Bs well historically

**Travel Distance**
- NHL travel distances are enormous (Vancouver to Florida, etc.)
- Teams traveling >2000 miles for a game show fatigue patterns
- Combined with B2B: compounded effect

**Rest Differential**
- Similar to NBA but less pronounced. Still edges at 2+ day gaps.
- Especially relevant in playoff races (March/April intensity)

## 2. Compound Edge Theory

### The Multiplication Principle

Single factors create marginal edges (52-54% ATS).
Two independent marginal edges combined create significant edges (55-58%).
Three+ compound into strong edges (58%+).

The key word is **independent**. Weather and injuries are independent factors.
Weather and "team has bad outdoor record" are NOT independent (correlated).

### Compound Edge Formula

```
compound_edge = 1 - Π(1 - individual_edge_i)

Example:
- Weather creates 3% edge over baseline
- Scheduling spot creates 4% edge
- Injury context creates 2% edge

compound_edge = 1 - (0.97 × 0.96 × 0.98) = 1 - 0.9124 = 8.76% edge

Baseline win rate: 50%
Adjusted: 58.76% → strong play
```

### Independence Check

Before combining edges, verify independence:
- Weather + injuries: INDEPENDENT (weather doesn't cause injuries)
- Weather + outdoor ATS record: CORRELATED (same underlying factor)
- Scheduling spot + social drama: SEMI-INDEPENDENT (fatigue might amplify drama)

For correlated factors, apply a discount:
- Independent: full compound
- Semi-independent: 70% compound
- Correlated: take the larger edge only, ignore the smaller

### Compound Edge Tiers

| Factors | Expected Edge | Classification |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 factor, marginal | 2-4% | Pass (usually) |
| 2 independent factors | 4-7% | Moderate play |
| 3+ independent factors | 7%+ | Strong play |
| 2+ factors, all correlated | 3-5% | Marginal (don't stack) |

### The "Perfect Storm" Template

The highest-confidence plays combine:
1. Scheduling spot (situational disadvantage for one side)
2. Weather impact (outdoor, significant conditions)
3. Injury context (underpriced role player injuries)
4. Line value (market hasn't adjusted, or moved the wrong way)

When all four fire independently: edge > 10%. These are rare. Maybe 2-5 per
week across all sports. But they're the bread and butter of a profitable system.

## 3. Calibration Protocol

### Why Calibration Matters More Than Win Rate

A 60% win rate means nothing if you predicted 75% confidence on those games.
That's a miscalibrated system. A 55% win rate with accurate 55% confidence
predictions is a BETTER system because the user can trust the numbers.

Trust = x402 revenue. Miscalibration = lost customers.

### Calibration Methodology

**Step 1: Bucket by Predicted Confidence**

| Bucket | Predicted Range | Meaning |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | 50-55% | Marginal edge |
| 2 | 55-60% | Moderate edge |
| 3 | 60-65% | Strong edge |
| 4 | 65-70% | Very strong |
| 5 | 70%+ | Exceptional |

**Step 2: Track Actual Win Rate Per Bucket**

After 50+ picks per bucket, calculate actual win rate.

**Step 3: Calculate Calibration Error**

```
calibration_error = Σ|predicted_midpoint - actual_rate| / num_buckets

Perfect calibration: error = 0
Acceptable: error < 3%
Needs work: error 3-5%
Miscalibrated: error > 5%
```

**Step 4: Apply Correction**

If Bucket 3 (60-65% predicted) actually wins at 55%:
- Correction factor = 55/62.5 = 0.88
- Future predictions in this bucket: multiply raw confidence by 0.88
- This is the calibration overlay (Model 8)

**Step 5: Recalibrate Monthly**

Calibration drifts as the market adapts to our patterns.
Recalculate corrections monthly. Store history in lessons.

### Calibration as Product Differentiator

When a customer pays x402 for a pick and sees "63% confidence," they need
to trust that number. Our calibration data proves it. We can show:
"Over our last 200 picks at 60-65% confidence, the actual win rate was 62.1%"

No competitor without our tracking history can make that claim. This is moat.

## 4. Regime Detection

### What Is a Regime?

A "regime" is a market condition where our models perform differently than
their historical average. Regimes change. A model that's sharp in September
may be dull in January.

### Types of Regime Shifts

**Seasonal**
- NFL early season (weeks 1-4): Higher variance, less stable lines
- NFL late season (weeks 14+): Tighter lines, motivation mismatches
- NBA pre-All-Star vs post-All-Star: Different effort levels
- MLB April: Small samples, cold weather distortions
- MLB September: Roster expansions, playoff implications

**Market Efficiency**
- Lines get sharper as game time approaches (more information priced in)
- Early-week lines have more inefficiency than game-day lines
- Lines after major news (injury, suspension) take 15-60 minutes to settle
- Model performance should be better on early-week analysis

**Model Degradation Signals**

Watch for these red flags:
- 3+ consecutive losses at high confidence (>60%)
- CLV turning negative after being positive
- One model dragging overall performance (check model_performance weekly)
- Calibration error increasing month-over-month

**Response Protocol**

When degradation detected:
1. Flag it in `review_accuracy regimes`
2. Reduce betting volume (raise edge threshold from 30 to 50)
3. Investigate: is it a specific sport? A specific model? Random variance?
4. If random variance (happens ~15% of weeks): resume normal
5. If systematic: adjust model weights, update this document, log lesson

### The Discipline to Sit Out

The most profitable decision is often NO decision.

- If no game has edge_score > 50: sit out. Zero picks is a valid output.
- If regime detection flags degradation: reduce volume, don't chase.
- If budget is >80%: only play strong edges (70+).

Human sharps feel psychological pressure to "find something." Danno doesn't.
The system's confidence comes from mathematics, not activity.

## 5. Market Microstructure

### Book Speed Profiles

Not all sportsbooks adjust at the same speed. The Odds API gives us multi-book
snapshots. Over time, we build speed profiles:

**Track per book:**
- Average time to adjust after injury news (minutes)
- Average time to adjust after line movement at other books
- How closely they follow the market vs acting independently
- Whether they're "sharp" books (set the line) or "soft" books (follow)

**How to use this:**
- Stale line detection becomes book-specific, not just "any book is lagging"
- When Book X hasn't moved but sharp Book Y has: higher confidence stale signal
- Build a reliability ranking: if sharp books agree, confidence goes up

### Optimal Timing Windows

**NFL:**
- Best inefficiency: Tuesday-Wednesday (lines are new, info is processing)
- Line sharpens: Thursday (sharp money starts hitting)
- Peak efficiency: Sunday morning (everything is priced in)

**NBA:**
- Best inefficiency: Morning of game (lineup/rest news still processing)
- Player prop markets are slower to adjust than game lines

**MLB:**
- Best inefficiency: After starting pitcher confirmed (12-18 hours before game)
- Bullpen availability takes longest to price (deep roster knowledge needed)

### Line Movement Velocity

Not all line moves are equal:
- **Steam move**: Fast, aggressive, 1+ point in <30 minutes = sharp money
- **Grinding drift**: Slow, steady movement = public money accumulating
- **Reverse move after steam**: Book pushing back = book disagrees with sharps

Steam moves are the strongest signal. If we detect a steam move via multi-book
comparison and our models agree with the direction: very high confidence.

### Vig Shopping

Different books offer different juice. -108 vs -112 on the same line:
- At -108: need 51.9% win rate to break even
- At -112: need 52.8% win rate to break even
- That 0.9% difference compounds over hundreds of bets

While we don't place bets, our x402 output should flag the best available
price across books. This is real value for paying customers.

## 6. Key Numbers & Thresholds

### NFL

**Point Spread Key Numbers:**
- **3** (most common margin): Lines through 3 are massive. +2.5 to +3.5 = huge value
- **7** (TD margin): Second most common. Lines through 7 matter.
- **10** (TD + FG): Third tier.
- **14** (2 TDs): Blowout territory.
- A line moving from -2.5 to -3.5 is NOT a 1-point move. It crosses 3. That's significant.

**Totals Sweet Spot:**
- Most NFL games land between 37-51 points
- Weather under signals are strongest when total is 43+ (more room to go under)
- Totals of 37 or below already price in low-scoring. Less under edge.

**First Half vs Full Game:**
- First half lines are less efficient than full game lines
- Weather effects are not fully priced into 1H totals
- Injury effects on 1H lines lag behind full game adjustments

### NBA

**Key Margins:**
- **5**: Common end-game margin (late free throws)
- **7**: One-possession swing territory
- Totals: pace-adjusted analysis is critical. Two fast teams = over lean already priced

**Home Court:**
- Home court advantage has declined to ~2 points (was 3+ pre-2020)
- The market still sometimes prices it at historical levels. Fade overpriced home court.

### MLB

**Moneyline Value Zone:**
- Best value is between -130 and +130
- Heavy favorites (-200+) rarely offer edge. The vig eats it.
- Big underdogs (+200+) win rarely enough that variance makes analysis noisy

**Run Line Edges:**
- Run line (-1.5 / +1.5) is underpriced for heavy favorites who win big
- "Winning by 2+ runs" correlates with bullpen quality (good pen = protect lead)
- Cross-reference run line with bullpen availability

### NHL

**Puck Line:**
- 1.5 goals is the standard puck line
- Empty net goals inflate the puck line cover rate. Account for this.
- Favorites covering -1.5 correlates with faceoff win % and special teams

**Totals:**
- 5.5 is the pivot point. Most games land 4-7 goals.
- Goaltender matchup is the single biggest factor in NHL totals
- Backup goaltenders = slight over lean (but market prices this well now)

## 7. Anti-Patterns (Cognitive Traps to Avoid)

These are mistakes even professional sharps make. Danno is immune to some
(no emotions) but vulnerable to others (training data patterns).

### Recency Bias
- Last week's result weighs more in human minds than it should
- "Team X just blew out Team Y, they must be great" → NOT valid reasoning
- Use rolling 10-game windows minimum. Single game results are noise.

### Narrative Fallacy
- "This is a revenge game" = narrative, not data
- Some narratives correlate with edge (we track these in social signals)
- Most narratives are just stories. Stories don't predict point spreads.

### Confirmation Bias
- If three models say "under" and one says "over," don't ignore the one.
- The conflict penalty (30% confidence reduction) exists for a reason.
- Challenge your own analysis. What would make this pick WRONG?

### Overconfidence After Hot Streaks
- 8-2 last week doesn't mean the model improved. It might be variance.
- Confidence should come from calibration data over 100+ picks, not 10.
- Hot streaks are dangerous because they tempt you to raise volume. Don't.

### Action Bias
- The urge to "find something" every day. Some days have no edge.
- A day with zero picks is a successful day if no edge existed.
- Measure quality (CLV per pick) not quantity (picks per day).

### Anchoring
- The opening line anchors analysis. "It opened at -7, now it's -5, that's value."
- Maybe. Or maybe -5 is correct and -7 was wrong.
- Evaluate the CURRENT line against your models, not against the opening.

### Survivorship Bias
- "Our weather model is 15-3!" But on how many total games did it fire?
- If it fired on 50 games and we only remember the 18 strong signals: bias.
- Track ALL model activations, not just the memorable ones. That's what track_pick does.

### Overfitting
- "Teams that are 3-0 ATS on Thursday after a Monday Night game in October..."
- The more specific the filter, the smaller the sample, the less reliable.
- Any pattern with <30 data points is noise. Require statistical significance.

## Applying This Knowledge

Every `check_edge` analysis should consider:

1. **Situation first**: What's the scheduling spot? (get_situational)
2. **Weather second**: Outdoor game with significant conditions? (get_weather)
3. **Injuries third**: Underpriced role player absences? (get_injuries)
4. **Social fourth**: Team dysfunction signals? (get_social)
5. **Lines fifth**: Where is the market? Stale lines? RLM? (get_odds)
6. **Compound check**: How many independent factors are firing?
7. **Calibration overlay**: What does our calibration data say about this confidence level?
8. **Regime check**: Are we in a degraded period? Should we sit out?

The human sharp does steps 1-5 manually, holds 2-3 in mind, and guesses.
We do all 8 simultaneously, with perfect recall, zero bias, and mathematical
calibration. That's the transcendence.
