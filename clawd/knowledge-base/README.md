# Knowledge Base

This is your Obsidian-like knowledge base that I maintain. It uses markdown files with wikilinks for connections.

## Features

- **Wikilinks**: Use `[[note-name]]` to link to other notes
- **Search**: I can search all notes for keywords
- **Graph**: I can visualize connections between notes
- **Version Control**: All changes are tracked with git

## Structure

- `notes/` - Individual markdown notes
- `templates/` - Note templates
- `graphs/` - Visualizations of note connections

## How to Use

1. **Create a note**: Just ask me to create a note about something
2. **Link notes**: Use `[[note-name]]` syntax in your notes
3. **Search**: Ask me to find notes about a topic
4. **Visualize**: Ask me to show the knowledge graph

## Example

```markdown
