## Overview

Content intelligence is a system that analyzes text to extract meaningful insights, patterns, and relationships. It goes beyond simple keyword matching to understand semantic connections between concepts.

## Key Components

### Entity Extraction
- **People**: Identifies names and roles
- **Concepts**: Extracts key ideas and topics
- **Events**: Recognizes actions and occurrences
- **Relationships**: Understands how entities connect

### Pattern Analysis
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determines emotional tone
- **Reading Level**: Assesses text complexity
- **Key Phrases**: Identifies important terms
- **Word/Sentence Statistics**: Quantitative metrics

### Visualization
- **Network Graphs**: Shows entity relationships
- **Connection Tables**: Lists specific relationships
- **Insight Cards**: Highlights key findings

## Applications

### Research
- Analyzing large documents for key insights
- Finding connections between disparate sources
- Identifying research gaps and opportunities

### Knowledge Management
- Organizing information effectively
- Creating semantic links between concepts
- Building comprehensive knowledge graphs

### Decision Support
- Extracting actionable insights from text
- Identifying trends and patterns
- Supporting data-driven decisions
