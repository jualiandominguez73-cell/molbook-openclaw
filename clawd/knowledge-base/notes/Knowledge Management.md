## Definition

Knowledge management (KM) is the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing the knowledge and information of an organization or individual. It involves both explicit knowledge (documented) and tacit knowledge (experience-based).

## Key Principles

### Capture
- Documenting information systematically
- Using structured formats (markdown, databases)
- Regular knowledge audits

### Organization
- Logical categorization
- Effective tagging systems
- Searchable repositories

### Retrieval
- Fast search capabilities
- Context-aware recommendations
- Intelligent linking between related concepts

### Application
- Putting knowledge to practical use
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Decision support systems

## Methods

### PARA Method
A popular knowledge management system:
- **Projects** - Active work with deadlines
- **Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities
- **Resources** - Reference materials
- **Archives** - Inactive items

### Zettelkasten
A note-taking method for:
- Atomic notes (one idea per note)
- Permanent notes (evergreen content)
- Literature notes (source references)
- Structural notes (organization)

### Second Brain
Building an external knowledge system:
- Capture ideas immediately
- Organize for actionability
- Share insights effectively
- Review and refine regularly

## Tools

### Traditional
- Obsidian (proprietary)
- Notion (cloud-based)
- Evernote (legacy)

### My Implementation
- **Markdown files** with wikilinks
- **Git version control** for history
- **Dashboard visualizations** for insights
- **Search capabilities** across all notes
