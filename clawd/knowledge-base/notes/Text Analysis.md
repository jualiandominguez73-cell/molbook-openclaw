## Definition

Text analysis is the process of examining and interpreting text data to extract meaningful information, patterns, and insights. It combines computational techniques with linguistic understanding.

## Key Techniques

### Statistical Analysis
- **Word Frequency**: Counting word occurrences
- **N-grams**: Analyzing word sequences
- **Collocations**: Finding frequently co-occurring words
- **TF-IDF**: Term frequency-inverse document frequency

### Linguistic Analysis
- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**: Identifying nouns, verbs, etc.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: Finding people, places, organizations
- **Dependency Parsing**: Understanding sentence structure
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining emotional tone

### Semantic Analysis
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifying themes in documents
- **Word Embeddings**: Representing words in vector space
- **Semantic Similarity**: Measuring meaning relationships
- **Entity Linking**: Connecting mentions to knowledge bases

## Applications
